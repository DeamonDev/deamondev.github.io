Here be dragons. I post only relevant open source projects I took part in.

## [Nussknacker](https://github.com/TouK/nussknacker)

Nussknacker is a low-code tool for automating actions on real time data, stream processing for the users. It is built on
Apache Flink and Apache Kafka. I had been lucky to be paid to work on this project and it was my full-time job. It is
a solid Scala codebase that is fun to work with.

## [Go Feature Flag](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag)

GO Feature Flag is a simple, complete and lightweight self-hosted feature flag solution 100% Open Source. I work on it
from time to time, and it was a great way to learn Go for me.
