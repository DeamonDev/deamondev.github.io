## Whoami

Hello! I'm a software engineer from Poland. I am interested in topics related to distributed systems, functional
programming and low-level tools for profiling Unix systems, particularly tools based on eBPF technology.

I am heavy linux user since 2013. Currently I am using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) distribution (but glorying
this particular distro gives me cringe). I use x86 Tuxedo's PC and I highly
recommend [Tuxedo manufacture](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en).

However, I have not always been involved in software engineering – my formal education is an MSc in theoretical
mathematics (aka pure mathematics). In the world of the queen of sciences, my interests focused on modern algebraic
geometry.

## Open Source Work

I'm an open source enthusiast and I try to contribute to OS projects. Click [here](/opensource) to see my contributions.

## What is this blog about?

My goal is to publish posts mainly on the subject of building distributed systems and anything else that I find
interesting at any given moment — I assume that my readers have a moderately high level of computer science culture.

## Whoami --no-tech

In addition to everything I mentioned above, I am interested in Christian apologetics – the thoughts of the Church
Fathers and, above all, the view/explanation of other religions from the perspective of Christian theology. I probably
won't discuss this topic on this blog, but I have a few thoughts that, who knows? May be published one sunny day.

Another topic that takes up my time is learning jazz and playing the piano. I will almost certainly not publish anything
on these matters. Anyway I recommend you to check out [lilypond](https://lilypond.org/) - a free and open source
software for creating music, ideal for [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) users.

## The aim of this blog

The goal of this blog will be achieved when at least one real, living and non-AI person benefits from it or become
inspired by materials found here. I have noticed that, paradoxically, although we live in an age of enormous information
noise (further amplified by AI), it is challenging to find posts on the use of advanced topics. Most developers do not
have the time or simply do not want to publish their thoughts, which is totally understandable as we are all limited by
time, commitments or other hobbies. I decided to simply add my small contribution to this noise — but in a form free of
advertisements and invitations to yet another mailing list. __My materials are and always will be available for free,
without advertisements and (hopefully) without the need of ~~JavaScript~~.__
